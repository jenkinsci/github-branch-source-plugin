<div>
    Determines how pull requests are discovered:
    <dl>
        <dt>Merging the pull request with the current target branch revision</dt>
        <dd>Discover each pull request once with the discovered revision corresponding to the result of merging with the
            current revision of the target branch.
        </dd>
        <dt>The current pull request revision</dt>
        <dd>Discover each pull request once with the discovered revision corresponding to the pull request head revision
            without merging.
        </dd>
        <dt>Both the current pull request revision and the pull request merged with the current target branch revision</dt>
        <dd>Discover each pull request twice. The first discovered revision corresponds to the result of merging with
            the current revision of the target branch in each scan. The second parallel discovered revision corresponds
            to the pull request head revision without merging.
        </dd>
