        One of the great powers of pull requests is that anyone with read access to a repository can fork it, commit
        some changes to their fork and then create a pull request against the original repository with their changes.
        There are some files stored in source control that are important. For example, a <code>Jenkinsfile</code>
        may contain configuration details to sandbox pull requests in order to mitigate against malicious pull requests.
        In order to protect against a malicious pull request itself modifying the <code>Jenkinsfile</code> to remove
        the protections, you can define the trust policy for pull requests from forks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other plugins can extend the available trust policies. The default policies are:
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Nobody</dt>
        <dd>
            Pull requests from forks will all be treated as untrusted. This means that where Jenkins requires a
            trusted file (e.g. <code>Jenkinsfile</code>) the contents of that file will be retrieved from the
            target branch on the origin repository and not from the pull request branch on the fork repository.
        </dd>
        <dt>Collaborators</dt>
        <dd>
            Pull requests from <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/collaborators/" target="_blank">collaborators</a>
            to the origin repository will be treated as trusted, all other pull requests from fork repositories
            will be treated as untrusted.
            Note that if credentials used by Jenkins for scanning the repository does not have permission to
            query the list of collaborators to the origin repository then only the origin account will be treated
            as trusted - i.e. this will fall back to <code>Nobody</code>.
            <strong>NOTE:</strong> all collaborators are trusted, even if they are only members of a team with read permission.
        </dd>
        <dt>Everyone</dt>
        <dd>
            All pull requests from forks will be treated as trusted. <strong>NOTE:</strong> this option can be dangerous
            if used on a public repository hosted on GitHub.
        </dd>
        <dt>From users with Admin or Write permission</dt>
        <dd>
            Pull requests forks will be treated as trusted if and only if the fork owner has either Admin or Write
            permissions on the origin repository.
            <strong>This is the recommended policy.</strong>
            Note that this strategy requires the
            <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/collaborators/#review-a-users-permission-level" target="_blank">Review
            a user's permission level</a> API, as a result on GitHub Enterprise Server versions before 2.12 this
            is the same as trusting <strong>Nobody</strong>.
