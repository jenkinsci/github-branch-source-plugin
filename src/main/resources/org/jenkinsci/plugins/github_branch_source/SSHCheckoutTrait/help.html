    By default the discovered branches / pull requests will all use the same username / password credentials
    that were used for discovery when checking out sources. This means that the checkout will be using the
    <code>https://</code> protocol for the Git repository.
    <p>
        This behaviour allows you to select the SSH private key to be used for checking out sources, which will
        consequently force the checkout to use the <code>ssh://</code> protocol.
