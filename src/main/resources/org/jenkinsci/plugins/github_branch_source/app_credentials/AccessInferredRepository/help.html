    When using this mode, the credentials may only be used in contexts where a GitHub repository can be inferred, such
    as in a Multibranch Pipeline or Organization Folder, or in jobs where the "GitHub project" property is configured.
    Attempts to use the credentials in other contexts will fail.
    The generated access tokens will only be able to access the contextually appropriate repository.
