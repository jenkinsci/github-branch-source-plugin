  <h2>Multi-Organization GitHub App Credentials</h2>
  
  <p>
    This credential type allows you to use a single GitHub App across multiple organizations 
    without creating separate credentials for each organization. It automatically discovers 
    all organizations where your GitHub App is installed and can generate organization-specific 
    tokens as needed.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Key Benefits:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No Credential Duplication:</strong> One credential works across all organizations</li>
    <li><strong>Automatic Discovery:</strong> Automatically finds organizations where your app is installed</li>
    <li><strong>Dynamic Token Generation:</strong> Creates organization-specific tokens on demand</li>
    <li><strong>Easy Management:</strong> Add/remove organizations by installing/uninstalling the app</li>
  </ul>

    <li>Generate a private key for the GitHub App</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h3>Usage:</h3>
  <p>

    configuration. The system will automatically select the appropriate organization-specific 
    token based on the repository being accessed.
