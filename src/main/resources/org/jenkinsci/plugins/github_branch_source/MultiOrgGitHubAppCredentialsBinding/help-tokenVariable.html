<div>
    The environment variable name that will contain the GitHub token.
    <p>
        When used with an organization name, this variable will contain the token for 
        the specified organization. When used alone (without organization name), 
        the binding operates in automatic mode.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Automatic mode:</strong> Leave both token variable and organization name empty to get 
        tokens for all organizations with standard naming (GITHUB_TOKEN_ORGNAME).
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Manual mode:</strong> Specify both token variable name and organization name to get 
        a token for a specific organization in your custom variable.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Naming convention:</strong> Use uppercase letters and underscores (e.g., GITHUB_TOKEN, MY_TOKEN).
    </p>
