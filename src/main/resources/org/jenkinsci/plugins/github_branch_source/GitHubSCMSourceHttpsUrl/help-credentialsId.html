        Credentials used to <strong>scan</strong> branches and pull requests,
        <strong>check out</strong> sources and <strong>mark</strong> commit statuses.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that <strong>only "username with password"</strong> credentials are supported.
        Existing credentials of other kinds will be filtered out. This is because jenkins
        exercises GitHub API, and this last one does not support other ways of authentication.
    </p>
    <p>
        If none is given, only the public repositories will be scanned, and commit status
        will not be set on GitHub.
    </p>
    <p>
        If your organization contains private repositories, then you need to specify
        a credential from an user who have access to those repositories. This is done
        by creating a "username with password" credential where the password is
        <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens">GitHub personal access tokens</a>.
        The necessary scope is "repo".
