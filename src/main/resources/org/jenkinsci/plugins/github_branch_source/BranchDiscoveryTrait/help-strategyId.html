    Determines which branches are discovered.
    <dl>
        <dt>Exclude branches that are also filed as PRs</dt>
        <dd>
            If you are discovering origin pull requests, you may not want to also build the source branches
            for those pull requests.
        </dd>
        <dt>Only branches that are also filed as PRs</dt>
        <dd>
            Similar to discovering origin pull requests, but discovers the branch rather than the pull request. 
            This means <code>env.GIT_BRANCH</code> will be set to the branch name rather than <code>PR-#</code>.
            Also, status notifications for these builds will only be applied to the commit and not to the pull request.
        </dd>
        <dt>All branches</dt>
        <dd>
            Ignores whether the branch is also filed as a pull request and instead discovers all branches on the
            origin repository.
        </dd>
    </dl>
